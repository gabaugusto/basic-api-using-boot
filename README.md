# API using Java SpringBoot

This project is a basic API built using Java SpringBoot. It serves as an example for classroom use, providing an introduction to building APIs with SpringBoot and showcasing various features and potential of the technologies involved.

## Technologies Used
- Java: The primary programming language used for building the API.
- SpringBoot: A powerful framework for developing Java applications, including RESTful APIs.
- Maven: A popular build automation tool and dependency management system used for managing project dependencies and building the API.
- Spring Data JPA: A part of the Spring framework that provides convenient abstractions for working with databases using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- Postman: A collaboration platform for API development and testing, which can be used to interact with and test the API endpoints.

## Features
This API will showcase the following features:

1. **CRUD Operations**: The API supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a specific entity.
2. **RESTful Architecture**: The API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), providing a uniform interface for interacting with resources.
3. **Validation**: Request data is validated to ensure it meets the required criteria before processing.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to learn more about building APIs with Java SpringBoot.
